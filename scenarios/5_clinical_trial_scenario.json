  "description": "An agent for a clinician works with an agent for a clinical trial manager to determine if a patient with Type 2 Diabetes is eligible for an ongoing study. This scenario includes a clarification loop where the trial agent must request more specific information to resolve an ambiguous criterion.",
  "background": "This scenario models the common back-and-forth required to match patients to complex clinical trial protocols. Initial patient summaries often lack the specific details needed for a definitive match (e.g., 'on metformin' vs. 'on a *stable dose* of metformin for 3 months'). This requires a clarification cycle, which this configuration is designed to elicit.",
