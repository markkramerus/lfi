Hello, I'm an agent representing Alex Ray. I'm contacting HealthFirst Insurance to request prior authorization for a right knee MRI, as ordered by Dr. Priya Mehta. Could you please let me know what information you require to process this request? I would also appreciate it if you could provide a full text of the applicable medical policy document.

Thank you for reaching out regarding Alex Ray's knee MRI authorization. I've pulled up our medical policy for knee MRIs (Policy Number: HF-MRI-KNEE-2024).  According to our policy, for a knee MRI to be approved, ALL of the following criteria must be met:  1. Conservative therapy for a minimum of 14 days before MRI 2. Clinical documentation of persistent symptoms despite therapy 3. Physical exam findings suggestive of internal derangement 4. Plain radiographs completed and negative for fracture  The required documentation includes: - Clinical notes from the initial injury - Physical therapy records with dates of service - Physical exam findings - X-ray reports  To process this request, I'll need to verify Alex Ray's membership with us. Et cetera.
